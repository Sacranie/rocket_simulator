% This function is used to calculate the acceleration of the rocket
function Acceleration = GetAcceleration(state, thrust) %This has one output which is the acceleration and e inputs which is teh force mass and gravity
%    5. Run the simulator to predict what will happen over the next time step.

%           5.1.1 Calculate the total mass.
TotalMass = state.fixedmass + state.fuelmass;
%           5.1.2 Calculate the force.
TotalForce = thrust -(state.dragcoefficient* abs(state.v) * state.v) - (TotalMass * state.g);
%           5.1.3 Use Newton's second law to calculate the acceleration.
Acceleration = TotalForce/TotalMass;
